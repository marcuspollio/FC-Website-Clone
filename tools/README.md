## Content Scripts

### `wip_wednesday.py`

Python3 script to generate a boilerplate WIP Wednesday article based on the activity from the [`FreeCAD/FreeCAD`](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/) repository over the past week.
It classifies Pull Requests (PRs) and issues, and produces a Markdown file with front matter suitable for use in the Hugo website.

**Features:**

- Interactive mode to confirm or adjust the date (defaults to Wednesday 12:00 UTC)
- Class PRs by type for general information: backport, feature, fix, and other by git branch.
- Group PRs by FreeCAD workbenches with commit authors, title and link for each PR.
- Generate `index.md` in the correct `/content/en/news/<YYYY>/<MM>/wip-wednesday-<DD>-<Month>-<YYYY>/` folder.
- Support non-interactive mode and GitHub tokens to increase API rate limits.

**Usage:**

```sh
python3 wip_wednesday.py [optional arguments]
```

**Optional arguments:**

- `--time <timestamp>`: optional date input like ISO 8601 (2026-01-01T12:00:00) or RFC 2822 (Thu, 01 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT)
- `--author <name>`: optional article authors field in front matter
- `--root <path>`: optional path to directory of website Hugo project (default: current working dir)
- `--ci`: optional non-interactive mode with automatically most recent Wednesday
- `--token <github_token>`: optional GitHub token or PAT (recommended to avoid rate limits)

**Output Example:**

```sh
Created: website/content/en/news/2026/04/wip-wednesday-01-april-2026/index.md
```
